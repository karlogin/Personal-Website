## Personal Website

HI, Iâ€™M KARTHIK PADMANABHAN.

I am a Passionate Game Designer/Developer who is looking forward to working in a kick-ass Game Studio. I am currently pursuing my masters' in Mathematical Computing & Data Analytics at Saint Mary's University, Halifax, Canada. 

My goal is to create the next big ML/AI Engine to be exclusively used for Games. I basically work with both Unity3D Engine and Unreal Engine. 

Some of the things that I am good at working with includes UI Programming, Procedural Environment Generation/Population, Multi-Threading, Performance Optimization, and Server Interactions.

This repo contains files to my personal website.
I have used multiple git servers to create and push the files to my website.
If you would like to know more about the same, please get in touch with me.

You can basically use the files here as a template. I have tries to keep the code as minimal as needed.
Most of the code should have comments. If they don't have then it means that I am in the process of adding them.

I have also tried to use GitHub Pages to have a test site.
The website score a 99% in most web test. I wanna make it score a 100%.
Also, the website contains more of a informal portfolio style. There is a blog scction thats being worked on actively.

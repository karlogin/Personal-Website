## Personal Website

This repo contains files to my personal website.
I have used multiple git servers to create and push the files to my website.
If you would like to know more about the same, please get in touch with me.

You can basically use the files here as a template. I have tries to keep the code as minimal as needed.
Most of the code should have comments. If they don't have then it means that I am in the process of adding them.

I have also tried to use GitHub Pages to have a test site.
THe website score a 99% in most web test. I wanna make it score a 100%.
Alos, the website contains more of a informal portfolio style. There is a blog scction thats being worked on actively.
